## About me

I am a fifth-year PhD student at University of Chicago. 
My real name is hard to pronounce, so I go by the name of Griffin.
My research interest is geometric representation theory, with an eye towards number theory. 
My advisor is Prof. [Ngô, Bảo Châu](http://math.uchicago.edu/~ngo).

## Academics

- **Qualification Topic** A summary of Godement-Jacquet
theory. A full note can be found [here](files/topic-full.pdf).
- Current research involves multiplicative Hitchin fibration and (twisted) endoscopy theory.
- A [summary](files/tfs.pdf) of Langlands and Shelstad's paper on the definition of endoscopic transfer factors.

<!-- I organized a reading seminar about algebraic groups in Spring 2018. -->

## Notes

- A short [note](files/pI.pdf) on p-adic integrals in algebraic setting.
- A tiny 3-page [note](files/HF.pdf) recorded during Ngô's seminar explaining 
the most basic part of the Hitchin fibrations, which I find both concise 
and conceptually satisfying. 
- (Possibly forever) unfinished [notes](files/gs.pdf) for V. Ginzburg's class Geometric 
Satake in Spring 2018.

## Misc.
- [CV](files/cv.pdf).
- I have become a Nazgûl, and ever been a servant for carrying out my Lord Sauron's Schemes, particularly the Final Object: the [One Ring](onering.pdf) to rule us all.
- I'm a gamer. The games I have been ~~wasting hundreds of hours on~~ enjoying
    - math (currently a professional player)
    - The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild 
    - Fire Emblem Three Houses
- I delivered a lecture about competitive Pokémon battle at the University
of Chicago during my teaching training.
- I also conduct some casual research in knot theory, during which I found a broken link on [Jon DeWitt](http://math.uchicago.edu/~dewitt/)'s page.
- The name Griffin comes from the mythological creature griffin (or gryphon, or griffon). My first name means "courage", and my last name means "king", both of which a griffin heraldically befits. The logo is my own design. It is a deformation of the Chinese characters for my name "驍(Xiāo)王(Wáng)" into a Griffin.
